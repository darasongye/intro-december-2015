Due to heavy user activity, the database needs to be updated so that it will function optimally.

The database will be divided into N fragments, where each fragment will contain all of the data related to each of the N users.

The Humpty-Dumpty algorithm will be used to create the fragments, and the Staple-Glue algorithm will be used to optimize each of the fragments.
